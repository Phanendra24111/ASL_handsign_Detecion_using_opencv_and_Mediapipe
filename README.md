# Hand‑Sign Detection & Accuracy Tracking  
*A lightweight Real‑Time ASL‑style gesture recognizer built with OpenCV and MediaPipe.*

---

## ✨ Project Overview
This script turns any webcam into a **hand‑sign detector** that recognizes a small vocabulary of gestures and keeps track of how accurately you perform them.

- **Real‑time detection** with MediaPipe Hands  
- Simple **rule‑based classification** using landmark angles  
- **“Capture” mode** (`c` key) to log predictions and compute accuracy  
- Clear on‑screen overlays for the current sign, captured sign, and running accuracy
